# ChainCoop Meeting Minutes â€“ [2024-09-06 11:24 PM]

## **Main Issues Discussed:**

### 1. **Inconsistent Attendance of Foundational Members**
- Concerns raised regarding the absence and inconsistency of foundational members like Ojeniyi and others.
- **Main Discussion**: How can we encourage members to attend meetings regularly?
    - **Suggestion**: Open the general group to bring in more people to increase participation and engagement.

### 2. **Department Performance:**
- **Marketing and Content Department**:
    - Handled by Abdulsamad, but since he got his new job, the content team has slowed down significantly.
    - The department is currently not functioning effectively.
  
### 3. **Launch Date Set for 17th September:**
- **Challenges faced**:
    - **Developer Issues**: One of our developers had laptop issues (screen broken and processor problems). This delayed tasks by two weeks.
    - **Wema Bank Account Issue**: The person in charge of creating the account for us was inactive for over three weeks. This was only resolved after a physical visit to the bank. The documents have now been sent, and the office space has been verified.

### 4. **Monthly Events on LinkedIn and Twitter:**
- **Guest Speaker**: Akin Alabi has agreed to speak at our event on the 21st of September at 5 PM.
- **Event Restructuring**:
    - Since we lack a strong content team lead, we decided to focus on bringing in speakers from specific areas:
        - **Copywriters**: To enhance our content creation efforts.
        - **People interested in joining the cooperative**: To expand our network and find volunteers.

### 5. **AMA Sessions:**
- Plan to organize AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions in various groups, including:
    - Software development groups (backend, frontend)
    - Content creators/writers groups
- **Goal**: Leverage these sessions to bring in volunteers willing to work with us on a voluntary basis.
