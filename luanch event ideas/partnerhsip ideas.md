Given that you're a young cooperative with fewer than six active members and little online presence, it makes sense to start by targeting smaller or emerging firms and platforms that align with your cooperative’s values, mission, and capacity. These companies or organizations are more likely to be flexible and willing to partner with a growing cooperative like yours.

### Suggested Approach:
- Start with **smaller, community-driven platforms** or **individuals** that align with your cooperative’s mission.
- Offer **collaborations in exchange for services** or **expertise**, rather than funding or large-scale partnerships initially.
- Build your **online presence step by step** by partnering with people or organizations that are also in growth phases.
- Target people and organizations that align with your cooperative values of **shared ownership**, **community focus**, and **social impact**.

This strategy will help you build credibility and gradually expand your partnerships and visibility.
