## Meeting Minutes - Content Team

### Discussion Points:

1. **Collaborative Posts for Quality Over Quantity:**
   - **Juwon** emphasized the importance of focusing on quality through collaborative content creation rather than just churning out content for quantity.
   - **Content King** disagreed, stating that collaboration might be difficult since each writer has their own unique style.
   - **Rebecca** supported Juwon's idea, pointing out that writers are dynamic and adaptable, which allows for collaboration. She also noted that we donâ€™t need to populate all social media platforms at once, but rather focus on the platforms where we have the most users.
   - **Rebecca** further added that we should avoid spreading ourselves too thin on platforms that prioritize video content, as that's not our main focus right now.

2. **Gitbook Account Suggestion:**
   - **Rebecca** suggested creating a Gitbook account to streamline content, but also raised concerns about the cost associated with the premium version. Further discussions are needed to evaluate the pricing and whether it fits into our budget.

3. **Abdulsamad's Availability:**
   - **Abdulsamad** informed the team that he would not be available until Tuesday evening.

4. **Audio-Visual Content:**
   - **Content King** suggested exploring audio-visual content to enhance engagement. He proposed either bringing someone in to create these or using an AI-powered animation platform similar to what Sterling Bank and other companies are doing.

### Tasks to be Completed:

1. **Website Content**  
   - Assigned to: **Abiade**, **Abdulsamad**, and **Ojeniyi**  
   - **Timeframe:** One week  
   - **Next Steps:** Content King and Abiade agreed to review the content by Tuesday. A copy of the completed content will be sent to Abiade for approval after Content King finishes it.

2. **Monthly Content Experts:**
